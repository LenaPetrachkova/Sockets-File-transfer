# Sockets-File-transfer
File transfer.
The `client` sends a text file to the `server` (with savings of its original name). The `server` saves the transfered file in its own directory. 

In the `client` and `server` consoles, the progress of data transmission/reception should be displayed:
- the number of bytes sent/received 
- the percentage of completion of the operation
- data transmission/reception speed at the moment

The `client` console at the end of the data transfer should display the time of the operation and how many bytes were transferred.
